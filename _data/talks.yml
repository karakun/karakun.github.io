  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: >
    In Java's history a lot of different UI technologies appeared and helped Java to become 
    an established technology for desktop applications. Especially the cross platform functionality 
    of Java enabled a lot of mission critical desktop applications in industries like the aerospace 
    sector, deep sea research, the stock market, and others.
    
    As we all know the market share of desktop applications has gone down during the last decade. 
    Next to mobile computing more and more applications move to web browsers. Based on this Java 
    desktop technologies are not as attractive anymore as they were a couple of years ago. 
    ​ 
    Nevertheless there is still progress in Java Desktop technologies and a lot of positive changes 
    and progression happened within the last 12 months. Together we will take a look at the current 
    state of these technologies, how they evolved within the last year, and what new developments the 
    future might bring for us.

    Let me seduce you!
    Talks in which you learn how to "program Java correctly & cleanly" has been seen way to often.
    In this session you will learn things you should never do in your next Java project.
    Let's leave the world of all this boring clean code and come with me on a journey into the shadows of Java programming.
    Even though Java is a solid & stable language, 
    there are still some loopholes that you can exploit with tools like Reflection to get really whacky results and effects.
    If you want to experience the pain of these hacks then you've come to the right place.

- name: '1 Codebase, 2 Mobile Platforms: How to Test iOS and Android by Just Writing Tests Once'
  author: 'francois'
  summary: >
    Developing consistent mobile apps on iOS and Android is difficult enough, but writing automated end to end tests so they run on both platforms without writing them twice is even harder. The limited selectors on mobile make it very difficult to only use one testing code base for both platforms. By using accessibilityId’s with translation keys in the same way as in the app, we use the fastest and least brittle selector on mobile possible, being resistant to tests breaking in case of text changes, allowing to also check the app in all languages without any additional effort.

    Using a hybrid framework like React Native or NativeScript with WebdriverIO, François will show how to use utility methods to cleverly encapsulate all of the platform differences as much as possible, so writing tests is efficient, readable and maintainable.

- name: 'Java Desktop 2019'
  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: >
    Some years ago development of Java Desktop applications was easy:
    We just downloaded Java 8 from Oracle and got a set of useful tools and framework to develop Java desktop applications:

    - AWT & Swing

    - WebStart

    - JavaFX

    - JFX Packager

    If you now download a Java version from Oracle (or any other vendor) several of the mentioned tools and frameworks are gone.
    Some JDKs only contain AWT & Swing for desktop development and miss all the newer tools. But even if they include such tools
    or frameworks you have sometimes no idea about their state.
    In this session I will give an overview about the differences between JDKs that you can use today and how frameworks like JavaFX
    are really supported by the vendors. Next to this we will have a look at all the tools that are important for building and installing
    desktop development. Since some like WebStart are gone you can find quite good alternatives.

    Once upon a time, there was a poor, innocent language. It was friendly and kind.
    Everything could have been nice and peaceful, but there was another language that
    was grumpy and mean. One day they met and started to argue about who the better language was….
    This session compares the Java language with TypeScript. It discusses how common problems
    are solved with these languages.
    At the end, you’ll see who is the beauty and who is the beast.

- name: 'Java 11 - OMG!!!!'
  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: >
    With Java 6, 7 or 8, the world for a Java developer was quite easy. The Java platform
    had a long running release cycle and versions normally overlapped for more than 1 year.
    Normally, you as a developer had more than enough time to prepair your applications
    for the next release. Once this was done, you simply downloaded the JDK from Oracle and
    installed it with the automatic installer. The biggest problem in that world was
    the Ask-Toolbar ;)

    Starting with Java 9 Oracle has announced a new release train and with Java 11 the licence
    model of the Oracle JDK has changed. Because of this, new vendors appear on the market
    offering commercial support for Java. But isn't Java 11 a LTS version that I can easily use
    for years and why should I use commercial support in this case?

    The keynote gives an overview of the history of Java and the OpenJDK. We will have a closer
    look the new at the release train to kill all the rumors about Java 11, commercial support and
    the future of Java.

- name: 'Progressive Web Apps and the Service Worker API'
  author: 'simon'
  summary: >
    Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) closes the gap between websites and native applications.
    They combine the high accessibility of web pages with the open standards of the web in terms of
    Look and feel (HTML, CSS), search engine optimization (SEO) and functionality (Push API, Notification API),
    Web Storage API, HTTPS etc.) with properties of native applications. So Progressive
    Web Apps can work offline (Service Worker API) and be added like a native app to the Home Screen of your device (Web App Manifest).

    This talk shows how to create a PWA. The focus is on the Service Worker API,
    which plays a central role for Progressive Web Apps. It will also show how the Web
    App manifest and which help to realize a PWA.

- name: 'Web APIs - The missing manual'
  author: 'simon'
  summary: >
    Web developers use different Web APIs every day. Often this APIs are well known ones,
    like the Document Object Model (DOM), the DOM Event API, the Fetch API or the
    Geolocation API. A kind of comfort zone is created, which one rarely leaves.
    The web provides many more APIs, which are rarely or not at all known.
    Do you already know for example the Web Speech API, or the Web Bluetooth
    API, the Server Timing API, the Battery Status API or the Credential Management
    API? These and other APIs are part of the talk to help web developers leave their
    comfort zone. Since the presentation includes many APIs, the attendees can choose
    at the beginning which APIs will be presented in detail.

  summary: >
    This isn’t a talk about microservices, NoSQL, container solutions or hip new frameworks.
    This talk will show some of the standard Java APIs that are part of Java since version 5, 6, 7 or 8.
    All those features are very helpful to create maintainable and future-proof applications, regardless
    of whether JavaEE, Spring, JavaFX or any other framework is used. The talk will give an overview of
    some important standard concepts and APIs of Java like annotations, null values and concurrency.
    Based on an overview of this topics and some samples the talk will answer questions like:

    - How can I create my own annotations?

    - How can I create a plugin structure without using frameworks like OSGI?

    - What’s the best way to handle NullPointerExceptions?

    - How can I write concurrent code that is still maintainable?

- name: 'Multidevice Controls: A Different Approach to UX'
  author: 'gerrit'
  summary: >
    Everybody knows boring form-based user interfaces. What if you could add mobile devices to improve
    the UX of desktop or web applications? A research project at the University of Applied Sciences and
    Arts Northwestern Switzerland has tried to address this topic in a totally different way. Usually you
    would expect to rework the UI and make it fancier, but here the idea is to enhance controls so they
    can reside on a mobile device. For example, you can think about a text input field that gets the focus,
    with the actual data input being done on a mobile phone. This session presents an overview of the concept
    and shows you some results of the research project in the form of demos based on Swift, JavaFX, and Polymer.

    End to end testing is a crucial part of a tool chain to deliver high-quality releases of many software systems.

    With Geb, we have a very handy wrapper to WebDriver/Selenium at our fingertips that enables us to create actually maintainable E2E test suites even for large web applications.
    Combining it with Docker and a CI system enables us to be very flexible about the context we use this tests in and allow us to provoke feedback for many interesting aspects we need to know about in our system.

    This talk outlines findings and experiences from projects that utilized the mentioned technologies to succeed in constantly delivering high quality releases not only in slides but also with some live-coding and demos.

    Starting with Java 11, WebStart is being removed from Java.
    Because even today several applications are built on top of this technology,
    it will be mission-critical for many companies to find a replacement for it.
    This session presents an overview of the features of WebStart and how they can be replaced.

  summary: >
    Build and testing a commercial software is easy. You can use a big infrastructure for CI and commercial tools to test your complete stack. And if you want to test your application on different mobile devices - well, that's easy! You company will buy them for you. But what can you do if you want to work on Open Source? You can not spend thousands of Dollars for a free time project and without a given infrastructure several build, test and deployment steps are just impossible...
    Imagine a world in that testing, building or deploying of open source software is at least as easy as for commercial projects. Maybe it's just easier and the infrastructure is better than in most $$$ stacks. I will introduce you to this world and show several tools and services that will help you to get the best out of your open source project - without producing any costs but with a lot of fun, cool new technologies and the freedom of choose.

  summary: >
    The real value in most client-oriented business applications is the data sitting on remote servers and cloud systems. Unfortunately, retrieving and displaying this data
    is an exercise left to the developer, and it must be done (correctly!) before end users can interact with it. Fortunately, the open source DataFX framework aims to simplify
    this by enabling JavaFX developers to easily retrieve data from a variety of sources in several formats and rapidly integrate it with JavaFX components (such as TableView),
    using typical JavaFX patterns. This session introduces the free and open source DataFX project, gives practical advice for using it, and provides insight into future plans for this project.

    JavaFX offers a wide range of default controls for creating cool and great applications, from business to entertainment use cases. Because JavaFX is a multiplatform UI framework
    that can be used mainly on desktop-based platforms and embedded devices, a cross-platform skin named Caspian is provided by JavaFX. As of Java 8, Modena will be a official second
    cross-platform skin for JavaFX, but some applications and developers have a definite need for native or custom skins for their controls and applications. This session points out how
    to create custom skins for JavaFX controls. You will learn that with AquaFX, this custom skin can even feel like a native one.

    JavaFX 8 offers a lot of excellent features to create modern and interactive user interfaces. However, in addition to a shiny UI there are other important issues that must
    be considered when creating enterprise business applications with JavaFX. This talk gives an overview of the various best practices on solving problems like client-server
    communications (transport), asynchronous vs synchronous tasks, MVC/MVP framework patterned approaches and designing of complex dialog window flows. Although the JavaEE
    platform already defines decent data binding solutions when developing JavaFX applications, this session will demonstrate 3rd party frameworks such as DataFX, ControlsFX and
    Open Dolphin. These 3rd party frameworks provide useful features that will ease development, thus reducing time and money on your enterprise projects. By learning these
    JavaFX enterprise APIs and techniques a developer will be able to focus on application building instead of the underlying plumbing.

  summary: >
    Finding the right architecture and remoting layer for a modern application of often very hard. In this talk we want to introduce the Remote Presentation Model Pattern
    that is based on MVC and introduces a generic model approach that can be used to define (presentation) models that can be synchronized between the client and the server.
    By doing so the business logic of an application can be defined completely on the server. In addition this pattern is a perfect match to create cross-platform apps that
    support real time updates and collaborative features. In this talk we show how the pattern can be used in a Spring or JavaEE environment by using all the cool features of
    this enterprise frameworks. In addition we will show how different clients can easily be implemented for an app that is based on remote presentation models.

    Writing a "Hello World!" application is always easy and a Java developer can learn how to write such an application with JavaFX in some minutes. But if you want to create a
    productive application the knowledge of "Hello World" isn't enough. A real application should be well structured, provide an automatic build that ends in useable artifacts
    and contain only needed dependencies. In addition such an application should be testable and maintainable. This talk shows some general concepts how you can create and
    structure a JavaFX application that can easily grow and become more complex without loosing control of the code, functionality and maintainability. At the end each attendee
    will have a template that he can use to start creating JavaFX based application.
