## Build instructions

In order to start `start.sh`  you have to install [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com) (see instructions online).
If you want to install [_jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com) ruby is needed on your machine.

If you have macOS and `brew` is installed you can easily execute the following commands:

```
brew install ruby
gem install bundler jekyll
```

Then you can use `start.sh` to start a server for local inspection (preview) of your markdown.
