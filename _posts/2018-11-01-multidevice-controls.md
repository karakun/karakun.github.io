Everybody knows boring form-based user interfaces. What if you could add mobile devices to improve the UX of desktop or web applications? A research project at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland has tried to address this topic in a totally different way. Usually you would expect to rework the UI and make it fancier, but here the idea is to enhance controls so they can reside on a mobile device. For example, you can think about a text input field that gets the focus, with the actual data input being done on a mobile phone. This session presents an overview of the concept and shows you some results of the research project in the form of demos based on Swift, JavaFX, and Polymer.

Gerrit did a session about multidevice controls at Code One 2018. We are really happy that this session was recorded at Code One and can be watched at YouTube now:
