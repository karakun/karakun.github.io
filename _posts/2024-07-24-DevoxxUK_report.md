Why should you consider attending a Java conference in 2024? Some of them are hybrid events; videos of the talks and slides are, thus, usually available online afterwards. In addition, computer science lectures, tutorials, 
and platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [YouTube](https://youtube.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, 
and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are available 24/7. We can always look for solutions, best practices, technology reviews, and virtually anything at any time and place.

Know what? Even in 2024, attending a conference offers tons of advantages. Meet experts in person, learn from and get inspired by their expert knowledge and experience, build your professional network, or share your 
experiences with like-minded developers. You will also meet people with innovative and unusual business experiences and ideas. That's why we endeavour to report on a Java conference with a unique community feeling.

# Development and the history of the Devoxx UK
"To understand the history of [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, you first need to go back", laughingly said Kim Fletcher, the Head of Event Operations, to me. The Developers Community 
Conference Devoxx, formerly Javapolis, has come a long way since its inception. Initially created by Stephan Janssen and run in collaboration with the [Belgian Java User Group](https://bejug.github.io){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
in 2002. Surpassing expectations, the conference gained a very high level of participation, and its popularity grew steadily. By 2006, it was the largest vendor-neutral Java-focused event in the world, with 2,800 attendees.

Devoxx has caught the pulse of time, forming a community that was in demand due to a highly dynamic IT scene. Growing to an unbelievable 3,300 attendees, Devoxx Belgium was sold out six weeks before the event. Due to 
the high demand for tickets and limited spaces, a notable milestone was the emergence of new Devoxx events, first in Paris, France, in 2012. Under the leadership of the community forerunners 
[Martijn Verburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijnverburg/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Ben Evans, [Dan Hardiker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhardiker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, 
and [Stephan Janssen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanjanssen/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the conference's professionalism was raised to a new level. The first edition of Devoxx UK took place in 2013, 
with strong collaboration from the LJC. 

In 2014, [Mark Hazell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-hazell-1507b83/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} took the reigns as Chairman. Under his expert guidance and alongside Dan Hardiker and 
[James McGivern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmcgivern/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, they gave momentum to the growth of the vibrant tech event to what it has become today; the event takes place every May 
at its established home in Islington, London, where it welcomes over 1,100 visitors. Through the years and with a lot of support from the community, the event, which started with 500 participants, mainly from the 
UK, grew to over 1,200 participants in 2019 and now attracts computer science professionals from all over the world.

The global Covid pandemic did not stop on Devoxx UK as the event has had to be cancelled, returning in November 2021 with a one-off Autumn edition run in a hybrid format. Since 2021, the main organizer's team of 
Devoxx UK has comprised Mark Hazell, Kim Fletcher, Dan Hardiker, Sam Hepburn and Ana-Maria Mihalceanu, who put their hearts and souls into managing the conference event, the community, the social events, inviting 
exceptional keynote speakers, and organizing the programme committee.

# Java Conference with a unique Community feeling
The Devoxx conference in London left a lasting impression on me, feeling more like an exhilarating party than a conventional conference. The atmosphere was high-energy, cool, and relaxed, marked by a free-spirited 
vibe and friendly, eye-to-eye conversations, even with high-level industry players. The event location, a vast, impressive, and restructured market hall, was expansive and open, facilitating easy interaction.

The conference format was innovative, with mixed presentations connected to Java, showcasing top IT professionals in short, engaging talks from different perspectives, rather than a single, lengthy presentation. 
Workshops ran simultaneously with talks, presenting the only challenge of choosing what to miss.

Meeting highly skilled worldwide professionals was a highlight, as all were remarkably accessible and eager to engage in direct conversations, further enhancing the dynamic and interactive spirit of the three-day 
event. An official pub event featuring tech karaoke, added to the unique environment, allowing attendees to see their peers in action, express themselves spontaneously, and enjoy a highly social experience.

All in all, the Devoxx conference was a breath of fresh air in today's IT, offering knowledgeable perspectives, unlikely entertainment and diverse social opportunities. This extraordinary conference has definitely 
left a lasting impression on many participants, as it has on me.
 
# Conclusion
Next time you're asking yourself why you should consider attending a Java conference in the year 2024, please keep in mind the strong influence of a supportive and friendly professional community on performance 
and well-being, you can meet it with participation, inspiration and support. Connecting to the developer community and IT professionals, those with whom we share interests, experiences, and a common path, not 
only makes us feel better and the world a better place. They help you perform better and the satisfaction with one's own activity is increased, too. Nothing can replace an in-person connection. As a developer, 
be encouraged to get involved with a meaningful group, be it attending a conference, a journal, starting a meetup, or volunteering. The benefits of knowledge and ideas sharing as well as engaging in community 
and connection not only personal and professional development, offer solutions to invariant challenges in the IT world, too. 


I especially want to thank Kim Fletcher and Dirk Kress, and, last but not least, special appreciation is due to Ewa Wagner - huge thanks for your input, invaluable support, and unwavering continuous inspiration!
