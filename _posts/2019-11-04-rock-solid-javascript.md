Many of today's Java applications have JavaScript frontends. While the Java part of the application is considered to be well engineered, the JavaScript part often lacks industrial-strength stability. Why is that? And what can we do to change this fact?

## Rock-solid JavaScript at BaselOne 19
I talked about this topic lately during the [BaselOne](https://baselone.ch) conference. This talk shows new ways to make your JavaScript code more reliable - not by introducing new frameworks or libraries but by doing less, going back to the basics, and leveraging the science behind the lambda calculus. Enjoy.
