[Rico](/rico) is an open-source application framework led by <span class="my-karakun">Karakun</span> supporting you to build better solutions in less time.

We are happy to share with you the new release 1.1 of Rico ([Github](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico/releases/tag/1.1.0), [Bintray](https://bintray.com/beta/#/karakun/Rico/Rico/1.1.0?tab=releaseNotes)). With this release, we provide full Java 11 compatibility and much more.

## What's new?

* Java 11 compatibility (while still compatible with Java 8)
* JavaEE migrated to JakartaEE
* Spring Boot dependency updated to 2.2.6
* Keycloak updated to 9.0.3

* [rico-js](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-js/releases/tag/1.1.0): 
  * updated dependencies
  * a minor change in date-handling
  * now available via npm repository: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rico-projects/rico-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rico-projects/rico-js)

* [rico-angular](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-angular/releases/tag/v1.0.7): 
  * Updated to use [rico-js](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-js/releases/tag/1.1.0) 1.1.0
 

We also updated our [samples](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples) so you can use these as a reference.

## What benefits can you expect from Java 11 compatibility?

* de-tangles JavaFX from releases by Oracle 
* provides Java Module System support
* clear, technically supported/enforced separation between public/private API 
* hide transitive dependencies 


## Outlook

With this release, we fulfill some of the steps planned in our roadmap. The next thing that will be addressed is the optimization of the Rico remoting protocol.
