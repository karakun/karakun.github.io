Between the 5th and 9th of November the [W-JAX](https://jax.de) takes place in Munich and some people from Karakun
will attend the conference as visitors and speakers. Next to this we prepaired some additional events around the 
conference.

### Conference sessions
Let's start with the talks that Karakun will do at w-jax. We are happy to announce that we will have 3 sessions at 
w-jax this year:

* [Java APIs: The Missing Manual](https://jax.de/core-java-jvm-languages/java-apis-the-missing-manual/)
* [Web-APIs: Das ultimative Handbuch](https://jax.de/web-development-javascript/web-apis-das-ultimative-handbuch/)
* [Progressive Web Apps mit der Service Worker API](https://jax.de/web-development-javascript/progressive-web-apps-mit-der-service-worker-api/)

### Free React Nighthacking
Next to the sessions at w-jax we organized a free nighthacking event in Munich together with 
[Eppleton](https://eppleton.de). Our JavaScript expert [Simon Skoczylas](/people/simon.html), will do a free [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
nighthacking in the office space of Eppleton in the evening November, 7th. You can register yourself 
[here](https://eppleton.de/kurse/react-nighthacking-mit-simon-skoczylas-eintritt-frei_55.html).
