### Angular client for Rico

We released the adapter library `rico-angular` to use `rico-js` for Angular based applications. Find more information on how to use it in the [project readme](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-angular/blob/master/README.adoc) and in our sample ["To-Do list application"](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples).
