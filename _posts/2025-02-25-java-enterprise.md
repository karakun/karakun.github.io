Enterprise solutions are designed to address the multifaceted
requirements of businesses and organisations. Compared to solutions
designed for consumer use, enterprise solutions typically have a longer
development lifecycle and require a higher level of investment. And it
is not only the development cycle - enterprise software tends to have a
longer lifespan than consumer-facing solutions. 

The lifespan of enterprise software can vary considerably, depending on several factors,
including the complexity of the solution, the specific requirements of
the organisation in question, and the pace of technological advancement.
This is partly due to the higher level of investment required, the
greater degree of integration with existing systems, and the need for a
longer return on investment. Probably a significant amount of
development teams will be involved in the software development life
cycle (_SDLC_) of such systems. It can be reasonably assumed that a
considerable number of these systems will undergo phases of
reengineering, refactoring, or redesign during this period. The process
is influenced by the fact that technology is an ever-evolving field, and
the tools and solutions that are currently in use may become obsolete soon. 
The notion that a design solution will remain effective
indefinitely is no longer a valid assumption. Consequently, the
objective is to develop solutions that can be repeatedly deployed to
address evolving issues, becoming progressively more sophisticated,
elegant, and intelligent over time. 

Choosing the right set of tools or platforms is a critical decision that 
will have a profound impact on every level of an organisation. The JVM is 
one of the most robust, dependable, well-maintained, secure and stable platforms 
for enterprise solutions globally.

Several scientific disciplines have illuminated the complex
mechanisms underlying the evolution, adaptation, and healing of
biological systems, enabling organisms to not only survive but also to
flourish, with life spans that greatly exceed those of humans. These
solutions from a distant past demonstrate the value of celebrating,
understanding, and appreciating the past as a foundation for future
progress. It is a challenging task to advance rapidly and not be
tempted by the hubris of complete disruption to move forward. It is
essential to strive for strategic improvement and change, with a
cautious understanding of potential consequences and a commitment to
building something better in their place.

It is not enough for us as professionals engaged in developing
systems and structures to merely create solutions that enhance the
quality of human life. Rather, we should focus on designing for the
well-being of the whole environment. Resources are finite! In this era
of rapid change, our solutions must be constantly up to
date with the significant changes taking place in our world.

_We have a duty and a responsibility to deliver and maintain applications
with higher levels of usability and sustainability. We should ask big
questions such as: what are the long-term implications of our
decisions?_

Designing long-lasting systems requires a thoughtful approach 
incorporating golden principles and powerful tools.

The Java development team has adopted a strategy that integrates proven
principles, thereby facilitating the evolution of the Java platform and
the creation of innovative features. Furthermore, the team has adapted
and delivered new features that enable developers to address present
challenges, establish a robust foundation for the future, and provide a
long-lasting platform that allows critical applications with a long
lifespan to be in production today and in the future.

Maintaining and evolving the JVM and the Java language often requires
implementing breakthrough features that significantly improve
performance or security. The key is to communicate these changes
effectively and ensure that users understand the trade-offs involved in
adopting new versions. By doing so, the Java team can foster a culture
that embraces change rather than resists it, encouraging organizations
to try new features and take advantage of the improvements in
performance, security, or footprint.

The Java programming language has undergone significant changes before
September 2017, but introducing a regular release cadence
encourages developers to adopt new practices and tools. By releasing a
version every six months, developers can access new features and
improvements more frequently. By committing to a predictable schedule,
Java has mitigated the risks associated with long periods of stagnation,
enabling teams to innovate continuously.

In my opinion, the most remarkable features present on each LTS version
released since Java 8 are as follows:

## Java 8: The Functional Push

-   **Lambda expressions**, **method references**, and the **Stream
    API** brought a functional programming paradigm to Java making code
    more concise, expressive, and often faster. Parallel processing with
    streams opened doors to efficient data manipulation, especially for
    large datasets.  **Stream API**, which allows for efficient
    processing of sequences of elements enabling parallel processing
    and improved performance. [Performance Enhancements & Modern
    Language Features] [JEP 126: Lambda
    Expressions](https://openjdk.org/jeps/126); [JEP 335: Method
    References](https://openjdk.org/jeps/335); [JEP 107: Enhanced for
    Loop](https://openjdk.org/jeps/107)


-   The new **Date** and **Time API** provided a standardized, reliable,
    and well-designed approach to date and time handling, crucial for
    building consistent and predictable systems. The Optional
    class tackled the age-old problem of null pointers, fostering
    cleaner code and reducing potential errors. [JEP 150:
    Date & Time API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/150)

-   Improved security features, including updates to
    the **Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)** and enhancements to
    the **Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)**. [Enhanced

    performance. [JEP 328: Flight
    Recorder](https://openjdk.org/jeps/328)

-    **Garbage Collector (GC)** improvements were added including the
    introduction of the **Z Garbage Collector**, which optimizes memory
    management and reduces pause times. ZGC is designed to handle large
    heaps (up to several terabytes) while maintaining low pause times,
    typically under **10 milliseconds**. This makes it suitable for
    applications requiring high responsiveness. [Performance
    Enhancements] [JEP 333: ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency
    Garbage Collector](https://openjdk.org/jeps/333)

-   Added **var keyword** for local variable type inference. This

    and controlled class hierarchies. This improves code clarity and
    reduces the potential for errors. [JEP 409: Sealed
    Classes](https://openjdk.org/jeps/409)

-   **Pattern matching** facilitates the streamlining of type-checking
    and casting operations, thereby enhancing the clarity and
    readability of the code in question. This feature enables the user
    to ascertain whether an object is an instance of a particular class
    and, if so, to cast it to that class in a single operation. This
    obviates the necessity for a distinct cast, thereby diminishing the
    amount of superfluous code. [Modern Language Features] [JEP 406:
    Pattern Matching for switch](https://openjdk.org/jeps/406)

    the scoped values introduced in earlier versions, this JEP refines
    the application programming interface (API) for sharing immutable
    data across methods and threads, thereby promoting more effective
    data management practices in concurrent applications.

In this article, I'm excited to give you an overview of the enterprise
software landscape and showcase why the evolution of the Java platform
makes the JVM such a powerful and useful technology. It looks at the key
considerations and advancements that have shaped the development and
longevity of enterprise-level solutions. There are five main things to
take away from this article:

-   Enterprise solutions have a *longer* **development
    lifecycle**, higher **investment**, and longer **lifespan** than
    consumer solutions. This often requires reengineering and
    adaptation to evolving technology, which is a fantastic opportunity
    for developers to really add value and make a
    real *long-term* **impact**.

-   The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a robust and secure platform for
    enterprise solutions. It's a great foundation for powerful and reliable
    software.

-   Java has undergone significant improvements with each Long-Term
    Support (LTS) release, introducing features like *functional
    programming, security enhancements, performance optimisations, and
    modern language features;*

-   The Java team has adopted an impressive strategy of integrating
    proven principles and delivering new features to address current
    challenges and establish a robust foundation for the future;

-   The regular release cadence encourages developers to continuously
    adopt new practices and tools, mitigating the risks of long periods
    of stagnation.
