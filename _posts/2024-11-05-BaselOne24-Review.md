Karakun is grateful to be part of the software community. Karakunies have had the privilege of speaking at conferences around the world, participating in unconferences, sharing insights through blog posts, and contributing to open-source projects. Did you know that we also have the joy of co-organizing a software conference?

# BaselOne - the ONE conference in and around Basel (CH)
[BaselOne](https://baselone.ch) is an annual 2-day event taking place in Basel, Switzerland. Since the very beginning in 2017, [Karakun](https://karakun.com) is one of the organizing companies of this community event. Today, we’d like to look back at this year's record-breaking edition.

## The agony of choice
Led by Karakun community expert [Ixchel Ruiz](/people/ixchel), the Call for Papers took place from Feb 1 to April 1, 2024. The BaselOne Content Committee received incredible 385 workshop and talk submissions by 214 unique speakers. Considering that there were only 24 session slots to be filled, the committee faced the agony of choice. And the result was absolutely amazing. 

BaselOne presented seven (!!) Java Champions and an exciting mix of local and international speakers talking about topics from Java to artificial intelligence and methodologies. See [BaselOne Web](https://baselone.org/slides-baselone-2024/) for a complete overview.

## Personal improvement for software experts
On its first day, BaselOne 2024 offered four workshops about generative AI, software testing and domain modeling. These workshops were attended by 75 software engineers which means a record since the first workshops in 2019. Some impressions:

## Attendance record on conference day
While BaselOne sold 270 tickets for both event days, we were happy to welcome 260 attendees on the conference day. This means a plus of 90 attendees compared to 2023.

After a short introduction by the orga team, the conference started with a keynote by Ralf Westphal. Ralf is trainer, consultant, author and co-founder of the Clean Code Developer Initiative.

His inspiring presentation was a lightweight opener for the following 24 talks. Two of them were delivered by the Karakun experts Iryna Dohndorf and François Martin. While [Iryna](/people/iryna) talked about the usage of AI-based tools in software development, [François](/people/francois) challenged the audience with his presentation “My code is faster than yours... let me prove it to you!” 

## A special location for a software conference
BaselOne takes place in the Markthalle Basel. This central location hosts different stores and restaurants as well as a huge choice of food booth offering meals from all over the world. Although this place is not ideally suited for such an event, it adds an unrivaled charm to the whole conference. Unfortunately, it may be the last time that BaselOne took place in the Markthalle as the event is growing and growing. The fire regulations only allow a limited number of visitors per room and we already reached this limit.
