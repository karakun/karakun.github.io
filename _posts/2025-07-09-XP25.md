The XP Conference, the premier international event on agile software development, was held for the first time in Switzerland, bringing the 
global agile community together at the modern FHNW campus in Brugg‑Windisch. Originally focused 26 years ago on eXtreme Programming, XP 
has since broadened its scope to all modern agile methodologies, establishing itself as a vibrant forum where researchers, practitioners, 
coaches, trainers, and thought leaders converge to share cutting-edge innovations and insights.

The theme of this year’s conference, “Adapt – Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”, resonated deeply with 
contemporary challenges in software development—especially leveraging emerging technologies like AI, navigating hybrid and distributed work, 
deepening technical coaching, and enhancing risk management.

Over four days, attendees explored a rich agenda featuring immersive full-day and half-day workshops, most notably “AI and Agile Software 
Development: From Frustration to Success”, alongside keynote talks, experience reports, research papers, and an interactive Open Space session.

## What moves the XP community?

To better understand the XP community, we conducted a short survey at our booth. Here are some key takeaways from the responses:

### Community counts
Over half of all participants said their primary motivation for attending XP 2025 was to connect with peers, ahead of professional 
development or interest in specific topics.

### Agile in practice is pragmatic
Most teams don’t follow one agile method rigidly. Instead, 63% say they adapt frameworks to their context, blending practices from Scrum, 
Kanban, XP, and others.

### XP practices are selectively applied 
While concepts like Continuous Integration and Pair Programming have traction, many teams still only partially apply XP ideas - pointing to 
an opportunity for deeper technical coaching.

### Team roles are fluid 
58% of respondents reported flexible role definitions, with many teams working without formally assigned roles.

### The biggest pain points? 
Teams struggle most with technical debt, communication, and quality assurance - a reminder that agility alone doesn’t solve core 
engineering challenges.

### Top development needs
Communication and testing were mentioned most often as areas needing improvement, followed by documentation and technical excellence.

### And if they could change one thing? 
Many wished for more technical depth, less rigid dogma, and a stronger bridge between research and real-world development.

## Our Take-Aways
We really had fun being at the XP Conference 2025 with our own booth. There was lots of time for socializing und insightful discussions. 
During these, our impression from real-world projects was confirmed: Agile is alive and evolving, but it’s also under pressure to deliver 
real value in complex, hybrid environments. Community, adaptability, and technical depth matter more than rigid processes.
