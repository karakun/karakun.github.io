This year Oracle does the first [Code One conference](https://www.oracle.com/code-one/index.html) in San Francisco. 
Code One is the successor of the famous JavaOne conference and will connect developers of different 
programming languages and backgrounds. Even with the changed name, Java is still very 
important and huge at Code One and the conference offers an awesome opportunity for our 
Java exports to discuss the future of the ecosystem.

This post will give you an overview about the activities that we have planed at 
Code One. We will write some follow up posts with more details of the 
sessions and events.

## Karakun voting machines at Code One
If you visit Code One you will notice the Voting Machines which placed 
at each session room. By using this machines you have the chance to give a 
vote for the current session. If you like the session you simple pressed 
the green Duke, if you do not like the presentation you choose the red 
Duke and if it's quite ok you select the yellow Duke in the middle.

We at Karakun assemble and maintain the voting machine for Code One 
since the concept behind this machines comes from our engeniers.

This machines were already used at JavaOne the last years and will 
be used at CodeOne again. After some polishing and rebranding all 
those machines are ready to handle your votes ;)

## Java Champions summit
Before the conference Oracle organized a day for all Java 
Champions with a lot of interesting content. We saw some quite 
cool Java content and had very good discussions. Since we needed 
to sign an NDA I can not write about any specific news at the moment.

## Need some stickers?
If you need new stickers, come to on of our sessions and help yourself!
