# <a name="devoxx"></a> Inside Devoxx Morocco
[Devoxx Morocco](https://devoxx.ma/){:target="_blank"} is the largest developer conference in the MEA region. 
It took place in mid-November in Marrakech. 
This developer event was characterised by energy, curiosity, and passion for technology, and offered many opportunities to expand one's network.
In previous editions, the founder even made memorable entrances on stage - once on a bike, another time with a camel - highlighting the playful spirit behind the event.

The conference provided three incredible days of learning, innovation, and community. 
The Devoxx Morocco conference left a lasting impression on me and felt more like an exhilarating party than a conventional conference. 
The atmosphere was high-energy, respectful, and relaxed, marked by a free-spirited vibe and friendly face-to-face conversations, even with high-level industry players. 
In addition, there were many opportunities to learn about Morocco's culture and history and to interact with locals - whether it was about current technological challenges and practices, or conversations about the best places to visit. 
When we immerse ourselves in new cultures, we gain the ability to see the bigger picture and a deeper understanding of the problems and challenges that we actually want to tackle with the help of technology.

What impressed me most, however, was the fact that participants and speakers were brought together with peers and professionals working on similar projects and topics. 
This was an incredible opportunity to learn and broaden one’s technological perspective. 
It demonstrated how well-thought-out the conference organisation was and how knowledgeable the organisers were. 
I, for example, had the opportunity to meet developers from the Miro team as well as OpenFeature community leaders. 

# <a name="history"></a> A Brief History of Devoxx Morocco

The 2025 edition marked the 12th iteration of the conference. 
It was a milestone in its remarkable growth. 
Devoxx Morocco began in 2014 under the name JMaghreb, a local Arabic-language community event dedicated to strengthening the regional developer ecosystem. 
Historically, the conference has roots in Java. 
In 2017, the conference officially joined the Devoxx family and, thus, became part of one of the world’s most respected networks of developer events. 

The first Devoxx-branded edition was held in Casablanca. 
Over the years, the conference has travelled across Morocco. 
In 2018, the conference went to Marrakech. 
In the following years, the conference took place in Agadir. 
In 2024 and 2025, the event returned to Marrakech, reconnecting with the city where some of its most memorable editions took place. 
From a local gathering to a major international developer conference, Devoxx Morocco has grown into a vibrant hub for knowledge exchange, innovation, and community in the MEA region.

# <a name="first-impression"></a> First Impressions of Devoxx Morocco 2025
The dreamlike venue, an impressive congress and hotel hall in modern Moroccan style, was spacious and open, facilitating interaction. 
Meeting highly skilled international professionals was a highlight. 
All of them were remarkably accessible and eager to engage in direct conversations, further enhancing the dynamic and interactive spirit of the three-day event. 
These conversations broadened my perspectives because we discussed the challenges, benefits, and problems that developers encounter in their daily work, and gained insights into developers' practices as well as into companies' strategies and structures.

# <a name="conference"></a> Conference Tracks at Devoxx Morocco 2025

Devoxx Morocco 2025 featured eight distinct tracks covering the full spectrum of today’s technological landscape: GenAI, cloud, security, people & culture, and more. 
The “People & Culture” track is considered one of the most important, highlighting the human side of technology and how teams, careers, and communities evolve. 
Among the many standout topics in that track were talks on keeping children safe on the internet, the realities of digital nomad life. 
The schedule also included career development sessions such as the rise to engineering manager, and even guidance on how to create your first conference talk - delivered by a remarkable 16-year-old speaker. 

Quality remains at the heart of Devoxx Morocco’s programme. 
The programme committee pays particular attention to the background, expertise, and relevance of speakers. 
As a result, they ensure that every invited speaker delivers valuable, high-level content. 
The event also serves as an important platform for public-speaking opportunities, especially for emerging voices in the tech community.

# <a name="takeaways"></a>My Personal Takeaways

The Moroccan community is incredibly talented. 
The excellent education in computer science and unparalleled networking opportunities enable valuable exchanges with top minds in the industry. 
And many young talents seize the opportunity to join leading companies in Europe and the US. 
Devoxx Morocco serves precisely this purpose and allows young talents to present their talks. 
This year, the youngest speaker was 16 years old.

An official post-conference event included karaoke, a guided tour of Marrakech, and a dinner in a desert restaurant. 
These activities created a unique environment, allowing speakers to see their peers in action, express themselves spontaneously, and enjoy a highly social experience. 
Overall, Devoxx Morocco was a breath of fresh air in today's IT event landscape, combining insightful content with strong networking opportunities. 
The conference left a lasting impression on me, broadening my horizons and connecting me with incredible members of the Java community.
