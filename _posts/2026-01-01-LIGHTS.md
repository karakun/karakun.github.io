With a very small budget, the [LIGHTS](https://lights.science/) project demonstrates how a practical, globally distributed research infrastructure can be built using familiar, readily available tools. [Health researchers across continents](https://lights.science/team-and-supporters/) collaborate efficiently on a highly specialized collection for methodological guidance - without complex IT operations or expensive software.

## The Mission Behind LIGHTS

The **Library of Guidance for Health Scientists (LIGHTS)** is a living inventory of more than 2,000 hand-selected methods guidance papers.
Its mission is to help clinical researchers find the best available methodological guidance to design and conduct high-quality studies.

Many clinical studies have avoidable limitations due to poor methodological decisions - such as inadequate study design, measurement bias, or flawed statistical analysis - even though suitable guidance documents exist. LIGHTS addresses this gap by systematically identifying, classifying, and making available methodological guidance documents.

## From Concept to Practice

The project is led by Dr. Stefan Schandelmaier at the University of Basel and technically supported by Karakun AG.

At the heart of the platform lies [HIBU](https://hibu-platform.com), Karakun’s search and AI platform, providing an intuitive and interactive search experience.
To feed HIBU with structured and continuously updated metadata, Karakun developed a special adapter system - a set of Java-based tools orchestrated through GitHub CI/CD pipelines.

## The Adapter: Three Pipelines, One Seamless Workflow

### 1. Paperpile and Google Drive Integration

* Researchers collect and curate literature in Paperpile, a web-based reference manager.
* A BibTeX export is automatically uploaded to a GitHub repository, triggering the first pipeline.
* This pipeline converts the BibTeX file into a CSV export, commits it to Git, and synchronizes it to a Google Drive folder.
* In Google Sheets, scientific collaborators enrich the data with domain-specific metadata.

### 2. Data Transformation for HIBU

* When the team is ready to publish, a second pipeline is manually triggered.
* It fetches the curated CSV from Google Drive and merges it with Paperpile metadata.
* The combined data is transformed into JSON objects, conforming to HIBU’s flexible index schema based on naming conventions (e.g., text, dates, multilingual fields).
* The resulting JSON becomes the search index input for HIBU.

### 3. Quality Assurance

* A third pipeline runs automated tests whenever code changes occur.
* It validates syntax, checks for duplicates, and ensures backward compatibility with data formats.

## Benefits

* **Version-Controlled Collaboration** – Every artifact (BibTeX, CSV, JSON) is tracked in Git without researchers having to handle Git directly.
* **Automated Validation** – Pipelines detect structural or semantic issues early.
* **Rapid Deployment** – New or corrected records are integrated into HIBU within minutes.
* **Low Maintenance** – Built entirely from existing cloud tools and open standards.

## Conclusion

LIGHTS showcases how **lean, automated data pipelines** can empower international research projects.
By combining common tools such as GitHub, Paperpile, and Google Sheets with Karakun’s HIBU platform, the team created a robust, low-cost ecosystem that turns methodological research into a truly global, living collaboration.
