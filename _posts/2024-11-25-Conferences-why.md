## Why Do I Attend Conferences and UnConferences?

Exploring the reasons for attending conferences or UnConferences has been a common topic in various insightful articles. Therefore, I will not dwell too much on those reasons but I would like to share my personal motivations:

* Connecting with like-minded people...
* Finding inspiration for what lies ahead...
* Seeing myself from a new perspective...
* Breaking out of my comfort zone...

When I attend conferences or speaking engagements, I often find that the people I meet have more in common with me than those on my own team. This shared passion for learning, networking, and inspiration fuels my curiosity and my desire to never stop growing!

While I am not an expert in every field, I strive to understand the usefulness and relevance of various topics. This knowledge, along with the opportunity to gather reference materials and discover new speakers, has proven invaluable to my personal and professional growth.

Sometimes I realize that I have forgotten the depth of my knowledge or why I acquired it in the first place. By sharing and discussing ideas at conferences, I not only deepen my own understanding but also break out of the confines of my own echo chamber.

## Why Present at Conferences?

There are many challenges out there that excite me: new tools, paradigms, technologies, or solutions that I want to try. If the topic is new to me, explaining it first in my head and later in front of a live audience is incredibly useful. Helping my fellow developers not to go down difficult paths when there is a better way is a plus... "Leave what you want to find in your path"

If you want to start or improve your conference submissions, here are my suggestions!

1. [x] Create compelling sessions and choose appropriate topics.
2. [x] For individuals considering speaking at conferences, it is important to develop a presentation proposal that will resonate with the predominantly technical audience.
3. [x] Including detailed case studies and relevant examples can provide valuable insights for attendees.
4. [x] When creating your presentation, focus on a specific key concept or solution that will be of interest to the audience. While it is acceptable to mention your company and brand, avoid turning your session into a product pitch. Instead, emphasize how your technology benefits the industry as a whole.
5. [x] Choose your session title and description carefully to attract the right audience. Consider the needs and challenges of potential attendees and tailor your message accordingly. A compelling title can attract attendees and convey the value of your presentation while a concise yet informative description provides a preview of what to expect.
6. [x] In addition to sharing your expertise, incorporate your unique voice and approach to make your presentation memorable. By connecting with the audience and showing your personality, you can deliver an informative and engaging session.

## Sharing and Creating Magic

One possible alternative to traditional conferences that may be worth considering is the UnConference. Rather than following a structured agenda with predetermined speakers, participants are encouraged to actively engage and share their thoughts in an open and collaborative environment allowing for a more flexible and dynamic approach to the event.

The concept of an UnConference is based on self-organization and participant-driven discussions where individuals have the freedom to suggest topics or lead conversations if they choose so. This format allows for connections and the exchange of ideas to take place in a spontaneous and inclusive manner facilitating a dynamic experience for all involved.

Organizers of these events want to create opportunities for creativity and diverse perspectives to unfold with the goal of sparking innovation and meaningful interactions.

Setting the stage for magic to happen! The right people, the right time, the right place! The result is truly magical!

Those interested in learning more about UnConferences and how to organize them are invited to visit the insightful resource available at [Unconference Format](https://jspiritorg.wordpress.com/unconference-format/). I encourage you to explore the various UnConferences available and consider participating in these engaging and interactive events that have the potential to expand your horizons and connect you with like-minded individuals. This is in my opinion the best UnConferences in the Java World! [JUnconference Alliance!](https://junconf.org)

## Middle Ground

When it comes to expanding your knowledge and exploring different learning formats, the landscape offers a wealth of options to consider. Among them is a unique blend of events known as conferences with open spaces which represent a refreshing approach to knowledge sharing. Described as the best of both worlds, or the worst of both worlds, hybrid events can be challenging to navigate, yet offer exciting opportunities for attendees.

A great example of this blending was [DevOps Days Copenhagen 2023](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-copenhagen/welcome/). Here, you can immerse yourself in informative sessions in the morning followed by an open forum in the afternoon. This innovative structure not only provides a balance between structured learning and organic interaction but also fosters a dynamic and collaborative environment where knowledge can be freely shared.

By combining the structured nature of traditional conferences with the flexibility and inclusivity of open spaces, events like DevOps Days CPH provide a unique platform for attendees to engage, learn, and connect in meaningful ways. Embrace the evolving landscape of learning and exploration by considering an open space conference - where the possibilities are endless and the learning never stops.
