title: 'JavaFX, Widgets, and Apps'
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Attend this session to hear about two exciting new OSS widget/app-launching
  frameworks, LaunchBoxFX and eWidgetFX, for embedded and desktop platforms. See
  how to create dock-based widgets ranging from mini-apps to full-control
  interfaces for entire systems—and everything in between. LaunchBoxFX provides
  a pluggable interface for development of dynamic widgets in embedded
  environments. You’ll learn how to use JavaFX 8 to create dynamic widgets that
  provide live updates and scalable monitoring/control for any number of inputs.
  With more resources comes more power! With eWidgetFX, you’ll learn to create
  futuristic, dockable apps that “snap out” for greater visibility and control.
  Learn to leverage the power of JavaFX on desktop platforms for user-awing UI
  results.
