title: Polyglott Java - a platform for many paradigms
speakers: mittie
excerpt: >
  There are many ways to program - and all of them find a home on the JVM.
  Whether you are a die-hard object-oriented enterprise programmer, a super-cool
  scripting hipster, or a scientific functional engineer, the Java Platform has
  all you need. In this talk we will go through unconventional combinations of
  these paradigms that enrich your solution space - scripting user-defined
  functions for a business application, building ambitious user interfaces, and
  creating rock-solid transaction systems. Java has something for everybody.
