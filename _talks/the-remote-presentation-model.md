title: The remote presentation model
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  Finding the right architecture and remoting layer for a modern application of
  often very hard. In this talk we want to introduce the Remote Presentation
  Model Pattern that is based on MVC and introduces a generic model approach
  that can be used to define (presentation) models that can be synchronized
  between the client and the server. By doing so the business logic of an
  application can be defined completely on the server. In addition this pattern
  is a perfect match to create cross-platform apps that support real time
  updates and collaborative features. In this talk we show how the pattern can
  be used in a Spring or JavaEE environment by using all the cool features of
  this enterprise frameworks. In addition we will show how different clients can
  easily be implemented for an app that is based on remote presentation models.
