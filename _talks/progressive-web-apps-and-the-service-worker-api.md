title: Progressive Web Apps and the Service Worker API
speakers: simon
excerpt: >
  Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) closes the gap between websites and native
  applications. They combine the high accessibility of web pages with the open
  standards of the web in terms of Look and feel (HTML, CSS), search engine
  optimization (SEO) and functionality (Push API, Notification API), Web Storage
  API, HTTPS etc.) with properties of native applications. So Progressive Web
  Apps can work offline (Service Worker API) and be added like a native app to
  the Home Screen of your device (Web App Manifest).

  This talk shows how to create a PWA. The focus is on the Service Worker API,
  which plays a central role for Progressive Web Apps. It will also show how the
  Web App manifest and which help to realize a PWA.
