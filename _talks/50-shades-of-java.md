title: 50 Shades of Java
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Let me seduce you! Talks in which you learn how to "program Java correctly &
  cleanly" has been seen way to often. In this session you will learn things you
  should never do in your next Java project. Let's leave the world of all this
  boring clean code and come with me on a journey into the shadows of Java
  programming. Even though Java is a solid & stable language, there are still
  some loopholes that you can exploit with tools like Reflection to get really
  whacky results and effects. If you want to experience the pain of these hacks
  then you've come to the right place.
