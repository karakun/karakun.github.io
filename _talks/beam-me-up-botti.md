title: 'Beam me up, Botti'
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Human-computer interaction has changed dramatically in recent years. As a
  result, more and more so-called social bots have been created over the years -
  especially in the area of social networks - which can be used both to obtain
  information and to enhance the user experience. In addition to "nice
  gimmicks," however, such bots are also being used more and more in critical
  areas, such as by politicians during election campaigns. Misinformation on
  climate change, for example, is also being spread more and more by bots. In
  this talk, we will look at how to develop bots in general (with Java) and what
  options are open to a developer. Together we will develop a bot and look at
  how easy it is to integrate and use gamification aspects to motivate users to
  interact with our bot. However, we will also look at the downsides of this
  technology, e.g. what sensitive data a developer might suddenly have at his
  disposal.
