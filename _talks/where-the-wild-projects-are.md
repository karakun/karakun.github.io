speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  Build and testing a commercial software is easy. You can use a big
  infrastructure for CI and commercial tools to test your complete stack. And if
  you want to test your application on different mobile devices - well, that's
  easy! You company will buy them for you. But what can you do if you want to
  work on Open Source? You can not spend thousands of Dollars for a free time
  project and without a given infrastructure several build, test and deployment
  steps are just impossible... Imagine a world in that testing, building or
  deploying of open source software is at least as easy as for commercial
  projects. Maybe it's just easier and the infrastructure is better than in most
  $$$ stacks. I will introduce you to this world and show several tools and
  services that will help you to get the best out of your open source project -
  without producing any costs but with a lot of fun, cool new technologies and
  the freedom of choose.
