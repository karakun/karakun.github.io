title: 'DataFX: The Best Way to Get Real-World Data into Your JavaFX Application'
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  The real value in most client-oriented business applications is the data
  sitting on remote servers and cloud systems. Unfortunately, retrieving and
  displaying this data is an exercise left to the developer, and it must be done
  (correctly!) before end users can interact with it. Fortunately, the open
  source DataFX framework aims to simplify this by enabling JavaFX developers to
  easily retrieve data from a variety of sources in several formats and rapidly
  integrate it with JavaFX components (such as TableView), using typical JavaFX
  patterns. This session introduces the free and open source DataFX project,
  gives practical advice for using it, and provides insight into future plans
  for this project.
