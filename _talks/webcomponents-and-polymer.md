title: WebComponents and Polymer
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Up until now it was almost impossible to create reusable components for the
  Web in a reasonable way. CSS rules and JavaScript variables would always get
  in their way in large applications. Luckily there is an initiative now to
  unify techniques to define custom Web Components

  Using examples we will show in this talk how you can build your own
  components. We will explain what the Shadow DOM is and will present tools like
  Polymer and X-Tag. This talk will give an overview of the current state of
  technology and a forecast of future development.
