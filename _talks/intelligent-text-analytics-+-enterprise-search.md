speakers:
  - iryna
  - christopher
excerpt: >
  Technologies based on intelligent speech analysis and enterprise search are
  increasingly finding their way into all areas of companies. They enable the
  implementation of digitization and automation strategies. Their contribution
  to the optimization of document-based processes and an improved customer
  experience is essential for businesses, politics, public authorities and the
  public to successfully master the digital transformation.

  In this talk we will discuss the technical possibilities of speech analytics
  and enterprise search and show how the Hibu platform can be used for efficient
  content indexing. Using practical examples and a demo, we will explain how
  methods of text classification and intelligent semantic search contribute to
  the development of smart functions and automated workflows, e.g. automated
  invoice processes.
