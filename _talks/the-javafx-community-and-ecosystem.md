speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Do you want to start working with JavaFX? But you don't know where you can
  find all of the cool tutorials and open source APIs? This session is the
  perfect place to be! Leading up to the Java 8 release there has been a huge
  ecosystem with a lot of good tutorials and open source frameworks surrounding
  JavaFX. Since this year the community is getting bigger and bigger. In the
  session we will introduce some of the most important parts of the JavaFX
  ecosystem like 3rd party frameworks and popular knowledge bases. We will
  illustrate the functionality and synergy effects between the libraries with a
  live coding session. Lastly, we will end the session with real-world
  applications demonstrating techniques and APIs discussed earlier.
