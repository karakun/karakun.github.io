title: Feature Driven Development
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  This talk shows Best Practices that can be used to develop application in an
  agile and feature driven workflow. Companies like flickr use this development
  process internally and even Martin Fowler defined a part of the process as
  "FeatureToggle".

  In the talk I will start with the definition of feature tasks and what steps
  and methods are needed to define them. Next to this an application is shown
  that was developed by the use of FeatureToggles. Here different architecture
  approaches in Java will be shown. Next to the architecture of an application
  the development workflows must be changed to create applications in a feature
  driven way, too. In some examples best practices to handle the new workflows
  will be shown.

  Methods and tools like the GitFlow, GitLab, the Java Togglz API and Jira will
  be shown in this talk.
