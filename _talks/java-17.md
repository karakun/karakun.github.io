title: Java 17
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  If someone told us in summer 2017 that Java 17 would be released in fall 2021,
  we certainly wouldn't have taken that statement seriously. But with the
  OpenJDK roadmap presented in September 2017 and releases every 6 months, the
  JVM has been able to make great leaps in the last few years and Java 12, 13,
  14, 15 and 16 have been released. You read right: since Java 11, there are
  really already 6 releases that add interesting and important new features to
  the language syntax, the JVM or the Java APIs. In this session, I talk about
  Java 17, the OpenJDK, different Java distributions and the Java ecosystem.
lectures:
  - BetterCode() Java 17
  - JavaLand 2022
