title: JavaFX in production
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  Writing a "Hello World!" application is always easy and a Java developer can
  learn how to write such an application with JavaFX in some minutes. But if you
  want to create a productive application the knowledge of "Hello World" isn't
  enough. A real application should be well structured, provide an automatic
  build that ends in useable artifacts and contain only needed dependencies. In
  addition such an application should be testable and maintainable. This talk
  shows some general concepts how you can create and structure a JavaFX
  application that can easily grow and become more complex without loosing
  control of the code, functionality and maintainability. At the end each
  attendee will have a template that he can use to start creating JavaFX based
  application.
