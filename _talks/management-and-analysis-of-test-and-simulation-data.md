title: Management and analysis of test and simulation data
speakers: simon
excerpt: >
  The amount of data collected during tests and simulations in the automotive
  industry has grown massively in recent years and there is no end in sight to
  this trend. Previous techniques for analysis have reached their limits. While
  the amount of data collected during tests and simulations is increasing,
  individual computers cannot be expanded to the same extent. This means that
  the usual practice of copying data to a workstation for analysis is reaching
  its limits. In addition, transferring and copying the data itself becomes a
  time and cost factor.

  This talk presents the various ways in which test and simulation data can be
  managed and analyzed using Big Data technologies. How do ASAM ODS and Big Data
  come together?
