title: 'Multidevice Controls: A Different Approach to UX'
speakers: gerrit
summary: >
  Everybody knows boring form-based user interfaces. What if you could add
  mobile devices to improve the UX of desktop or web applications? A research
  project at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern
  Switzerland has tried to address this topic in a totally different way.
  Usually you would expect to rework the UI and make it fancier, but here the
  idea is to enhance controls so they can reside on a mobile device. For
  example, you can think about a text input field that gets the focus, with the
  actual data input being done on a mobile phone. This session presents an
  overview of the concept and shows you some results of the research project in
  the form of demos based on Swift, JavaFX, and Polymer.
