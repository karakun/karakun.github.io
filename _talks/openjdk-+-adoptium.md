title: OpenJDK & Adoptium
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  In the last few years, there have been many rumors in the Java community about
  the new roadmap of Java and the OpenJDK. Next to this, Oracle changed its
  licensing terms for the Oracle JDK. Today, you can no longer simply download
  your Java Runtime from Oracle and use it for free on your company servers. You
  have to choose between different providers. One of these runtime providers is
  Eclipse Adoptium. But who is behind Eclipse Adoptium and how do their Java
  distribution Temurin and its licenses differ from other providers? And what
  does AdoptOpenJDK or OpenJDK have to do with it?

  As a working group member and committer of Adoptium, I will give an overview
  of the origin and intention of Eclipse Adoptium and show how this huge
  community-based project for the free reuse of Java has emerged within the last
  years. Of course, questions about security and future-proofing of Adoptium and
  OpenJDK will also be addressed. Additionally, I will show the current and
  future goals of the project and also give ideas how interested participants
  can participate and contribute to the project.
