title: Java Desktop 2019
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Some years ago development of Java Desktop applications was easy: We just
  downloaded Java 8 from Oracle and got a set of useful tools and framework to
  develop Java desktop applications:

  - AWT & Swing

  - WebStart

  - JavaFX

  - JFX Packager

  If you now download a Java version from Oracle (or any other vendor) several
  of the mentioned tools and frameworks are gone. Some JDKs only contain AWT &
  Swing for desktop development and miss all the newer tools. But even if they
  include such tools or frameworks you have sometimes no idea about their state.
  In this session I will give an overview about the differences between JDKs
  that you can use today and how frameworks like JavaFX are really supported by
  the vendors. Next to this we will have a look at all the tools that are
  important for building and installing desktop development. Since some like
  WebStart are gone you can find quite good alternatives.
