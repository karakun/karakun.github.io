title: JavaFX Enterprise
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  JavaFX 8 offers a lot of excellent features to create modern and interactive
  user interfaces. However, in addition to a shiny UI there are other important
  issues that must be considered when creating enterprise business applications
  with JavaFX. This talk gives an overview of the various best practices on
  solving problems like client-server communications (transport), asynchronous
  vs synchronous tasks, MVC/MVP framework patterned approaches and designing of
  complex dialog window flows. Although the JavaEE platform already defines
  decent data binding solutions when developing JavaFX applications, this
  session will demonstrate 3rd party frameworks such as DataFX, ControlsFX and
  Open Dolphin. These 3rd party frameworks provide useful features that will
  ease development, thus reducing time and money on your enterprise projects. By
  learning these JavaFX enterprise APIs and techniques a developer will be able
  to focus on application building instead of the underlying plumbing.
