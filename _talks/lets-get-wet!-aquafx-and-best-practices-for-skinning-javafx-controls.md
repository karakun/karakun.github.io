title: Let’s Get Wet! AquaFX and Best Practices for Skinning JavaFX Controls
speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  JavaFX offers a wide range of default controls for creating cool and great
  applications, from business to entertainment use cases. Because JavaFX is a
  multiplatform UI framework that can be used mainly on desktop-based platforms
  and embedded devices, a cross-platform skin named Caspian is provided by
  JavaFX. As of Java 8, Modena will be a official second cross-platform skin for
  JavaFX, but some applications and developers have a definite need for native
  or custom skins for their controls and applications. This session points out
  how to create custom skins for JavaFX controls. You will learn that with
  AquaFX, this custom skin can even feel like a native one.
