title: Singularity by mistake - Why my AI is wiping out humanity
speakers: christopher
excerpt: >
  In movie blockbusters, we learn that artificial intelligence can rise against
  humanity and sound the death knell of the world. Is this just Hollywood
  fantasy or already reality? And why is Elon Musk "afraid" of the AI future?

  In this talk, we will deal with failed AI learnings and the abstruse results
  that can be created by such learning attempts. Here we will have a look at
  difference areas of AI like NLP or reinforcement learning. Ever thought about
  a PacMan that is controlled by an evil AI and how such character would act? We
  will look at the errors that can occur during learning processes. Here we will
  not only see amusing results, but also scenarios that can be a real danger in
  a productive environment. In the conclusion will also take a closer look at
  the causes of these failed learning processes and discuss what can be done to
  avoid such problems and pitfalls.
