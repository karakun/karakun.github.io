speakers: hendrik
summary: >
  Content management systems, web browsers or operating systems: many of these
  products and services that we use every day are now implemented as open source
  projects. Due to the high influence that open source development has on the
  digital world, there are also many different statements about the advantages
  and dangers of open source products. Especially if you are not familiar with
  the subject matter, it is difficult to make a technically correct assessment
  of open source products

  The knowledge presented in this talk should help to better understand and
  evaluate open source software. Using this knowledge, the various dangers and

  evaluated in the future.
