title: I know what you did last summer
speakers:
  - hendrik
  - stephanc
summary: >
  Can you say the same about your Java applications? Today, applications run not
  only as monoliths on a server, but also distributed as (micro-)services in the
  cloud. Continuous monitoring is becoming more important in such scenarios. For
  example, as soon as you want to be informed about running out of memory, too
  many user sessions or increasing memory consumption, logging alone is no
  longer sufficient. For these and many other scenarios, metrics are the tool of
  choice today.

  In this session we will look at how to implement, visualize and evaluate
  metrics for Java applications. We will not only look at products and
  ready-to-use solutions like Grafana or Prometheus. Rather, we also want to
  find out how to implement metrics in Java in a meaningful way without vendor
  lock-in. With Micrometer and Java Flight Recorder, for example, there are
  several APIs that can be used to easily extend a Java application with metrics
  and the possibility of continuous monitoring. Together we will look at
  different approaches and discuss best practices or pitfalls when using
  metrics.
