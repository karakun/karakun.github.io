title: Web APIs - The missing manual
speakers: simon
summary: >
  Web developers use different Web APIs every day. Often this APIs are well
  known ones, like the Document Object Model (DOM), the DOM Event API, the Fetch
  API or the Geolocation API. A kind of comfort zone is created, which one
  rarely leaves. The web provides many more APIs, which are rarely or not at all
  known. Do you already know for example the Web Speech API, or the Web
  Bluetooth API, the Server Timing API, the Battery Status API or the Credential
  Management API? These and other APIs are part of the talk to help web
  developers leave their comfort zone. Since the presentation includes many
  APIs, the attendees can choose at the beginning which APIs will be presented
  in detail.
