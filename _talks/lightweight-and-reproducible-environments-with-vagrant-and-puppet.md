title: Lightweight and reproducible environments with Vagrant and Puppet
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Many developers are in need of complex development- and test environments for
  different projects with customers. The ideal situation would be to have them
  running in a sandbox. With help of the Cloud and VMs it's possible to create
  those sandbox-environments but administration, configuration and maintenance
  cost a lot of time and money. With a combination of Vagrant & Puppet it's
  possible to create and configure those environments "on the fly". Anytime,
  anywhere and above all reproducible. The Talk shows how fast you can create
  and configure a sandbox for a Java environment including an Application Server
  and a database with the help of those tools.
