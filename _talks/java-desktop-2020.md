  In Java's history a lot of different UI technologies appeared and helped Java
  to become an established technology for desktop applications. Especially the
  cross platform functionality of Java enabled a lot of mission critical desktop
  applications in industries like the aerospace sector, deep sea research, the
  stock market, and others.

  As we all know the market share of desktop applications has gone down during
  the last decade. Next to mobile computing more and more applications move to
  web browsers. Based on this Java desktop technologies are not as attractive
  anymore as they were a couple of years ago. ​ Nevertheless there is still
  progress in Java Desktop technologies and a lot of positive changes and
  progression happened within the last 12 months. Together we will take a look
