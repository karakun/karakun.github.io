  framework. Next to this we will answer questions like:

  - Which features do provide all of them, what are their unique selling points?

  - How do I start writing microservices with the different frameworks?

  - Which technology stack do the different frameworks use?

  - How do they perform in regards to startup time, and responding with
  different response sizes?
