title: 'The path to CD: End-to-End with Docker and Geb'
speakers: markus
excerpt: >
  End to end testing is a crucial part of a tool chain to deliver high-quality
  releases of many software systems.

  With Geb, we have a very handy wrapper to WebDriver/Selenium at our fingertips
  that enables us to create actually maintainable E2E test suites even for large
  web applications. Combining it with Docker and a CI system enables us to be
  very flexible about the context we use this tests in and allow us to provoke
  feedback for many interesting aspects we need to know about in our system.

  This talk outlines findings and experiences from projects that utilized the
  mentioned technologies to succeed in constantly delivering high quality
  releases not only in slides but also with some live-coding and demos.
