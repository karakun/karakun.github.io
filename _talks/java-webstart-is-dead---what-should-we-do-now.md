title: Java WebStart is dead - What should we do now?
speakers: hendrik
excerpt: >
  Starting with Java 11, WebStart is being removed from Java. Because even today
  several applications are built on top of this technology, it will be
  mission-critical for many companies to find a replacement for it. This session
  presents an overview of the features of WebStart and how they can be replaced.
  It includes samples of several open source and commercial tools that provide
  such features and might mean new and cool possibilities for WebStart-based
  applications.
